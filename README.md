Interactive development Assignment 3 -Natalie &amp; YuXuan

Project's Name
This website is created by LuoYuXuan and Natalie Long Hui Ying as a tool to assess human personality.
Personality testing and assessment refer to techniques designed to measure the
characteristic patterns of traits that people exhibit across various situations.

Personality tests can be used to help clarify a clinical diagnosis, guide therapeutic interventions, and help predict how people may respond in different situations.       When we talk about ourselves and others, we frequently refer to different characteristics of an individual's personality. Psychologists do much the same thing when
they assess personality but on a more systematic and scientific level.

# Features
<!-- Existing Features-->

## Outline
We have a personality test that consists of 40 questions to determine your 4 letter personality. The first 10 questions determine whether you are an extrovert or an introvert. The next 10 questions determine whether you are an intuitive or sensing person. The next 10 questions determine whether you are a thinking or feeling person. The last 10 questions determine whether you are an perceiving or judging person.

Besides that,we have the 16 individual results for the user to better understand themselves.

## Features Left to Implement
Allow a range of options to choose instead of only true and false
Add colours and validation for the options
